Sending Blinking & Buzzing command that lasts longer than 2 seconds can result in terminal restart. It's best to send at most 3 repetitions of a given pattern. After command timeouts the reader may no longer respond properly. Unplugging the reader and plugging it again will fix this problem.

Setting PICC parameters to incorrect values may result in bricking the terminal.
Usually unplugging the reader and plugging it again is enough to reset the reader configuration.
If this does not help, you will need to install official ACR122 drivers and sample applications. They will allow you to reset PICC parameters to their original values.
